    Assignment: Sorting Experiments

        Original Assignment Instructions:

        Implement 3 different sorting algorithms on arrays of size 5000. You may choose the sorting
        algorithms, but select one sort from each runtime category: O(n2), O(n log n), O(n). You do not
        need to write the sort code from scratch, however, you should reference where you obtained the
        code if you copy/paste or type exact code from another source.

            - Implement a separate counter for each sort. Initialize the counter to zero and increment
              inside loops of the associated sort. For example, in the O(n2) loop, increment the counter
              inside the inner loop. For recursive sorts, use a global counter; other sorts should either pass
              back the count using a return statement or use a reference variable for the count.

            - Use a system clock timer to start the time immediately before each sort and end immediately
              after each sort. If you donâ€™t know how to do this, Google is your friend. If you still have
              trouble with implementation, see me.

            - Once you have the code working for one run, average the time and counter results over 20
              runs, using a different random seed for each run. An easy way to do this is to use the loop
              control variable as the random seed, rather than time(NULL). Make sure that the arrays
              hold identical values before sorting

        Sort Used:

            - Hash Table        O(n)
            - Radix Sort        O(n)
            - Hash Map          O(n)
            - Heap Sort         O(n log n)
            - Quicksort         O(n log n)
            - Selection sort    O(n^2)
            - Bubble Sort       O(n^2)
            - Stack Sort        O(n^4)

    Description:
		This class is responsible for instantiating an instance of the sort experiment. When an object
        of this class is created, it will initialize an integer array with random numbers and make a 
        copy of this array and send it to the different sorts to be executed and timed as well as
        keeping track of the total number of computations that occur during these sorts. 

        The sorts are all conducted using namespaces that are included from various .hpp files. This
        assignment is somewhat similar to one we did in programming techniques and Dr. Griffin gave us
        some starter code using this namespaced sorting technique so I can't take all the credit for the
        layout. However I have added a significant amount of additional features and sorts to make sure I
        wasn't simply resubmitting a project we already did. In total I have implemented 8 sorts, 
        2 n-squared sorts, 2 n-log-n sorts, 2 linear sorts, and one "bad" sort method that though terrible 
        in Big O terms was fairly interesting, and somewhat tricky to get right.


	Public Methods:
		- Sorts() - Default Constructor
		- Sorts(int S) - Overloaded Constructer
		- vector<float> getTimes() - Returns a vector of run times
		- vector<string> getSorts() - Returns a vector of sort names
		- vector<int> getComps() - Returns a vector of computations
		- void loadData() - Initializes the array of numbers to be sorted with random numbers
		- void printData() - Utility function
		- void copyArray() - Makes a copy of the array that is sent to all the sort functions
		- void runExperiment() - Method that sends the copy array to all the sorts

	Usage:
		- This class creates an object that will run an instance of the sort experiment

    Description:
		This class is the main driver of the program. The class will either take a default int
        or have an integer passed in at object declaration that will serve as how many "runs"
        we will conduct on the Sorting Experiment. This will then start a loop up to this number
        and at each iteration, a new Sorts object is created to conduct an instance of the
        experiment. Once that object's experiment is complete, the results are written, then the
        object is destroyed and a new one is created when the loop increments.

        In order to get easier access to some of the data that is calaculated in the other class,
        these classes make use of the friend operator that allows them to have access to and call
        their public methods. 

        Once the runs are complete, the results are printed and written to an outfile.


	Public Methods:
		- SortExperiment() - Default Constructor
		- SortExperiment(int num) - Overloaded Constructer
		- void showExperimentResults(const char* h) - Print results and writes to file
		- void calculateAvgs() - Calculates the runtime and computation averages for each sort
		- void startExperiment() - Starts the process of running the experiment multiple times

	Usage:
		- This class creates an object that will coordinate running the sort experiment several times
